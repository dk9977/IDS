Intrusion Detection Systems

This work was all part of a class. These projects are about classifying intrusion data. The included papers show my methodology and results.
The input files are very large and in the .arff format for WEKA, so they were excluded here. The work of classification was performed within WEKA.

The first project involved classification of intrusive traffic with a random forest.
The second project involved classification of intrusive traffic with a multilayer perceptron.
The third project was somply a presentation to compare the results of the previous 2 projects.
